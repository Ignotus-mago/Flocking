This Processing project adapts the Flocking05.java application and its dependent classes that I developed in the Eclipse IDE, using the Processing library (processing.core) and other libraries contributed to the Processing community. Eclipse is a good working environment for developing Processing once you reach a certain level of proficiency with Java and want to create more complex applications that can easily be done in Processing. However, it can be useful to port applications developed in Eclipse back to Processing. 

There are several ways to do this. In this demo, I have turned my .java classes into Processing tabs. 

For more information, see the document ProcessingEclipse.txt.

Currently runs in Processing 2.2.1. I have not tested Processing 3.x, but it will probably run with a few tweaks to remove deprecated or obsolete code.
