# Flocking

Examples of boids that draw, some driven by video optical flow.
Examples all save drawings to Adobe Illustrator 7.0 format using IgnoCodeLib.
Based on Flocking, by Daniel Shiffman <http://www.shiffman.net>, in The Nature of Code, Spring 2009.
Demonstration of Craig Reynolds' "Flocking" behavior, See: http://www.red3d.com/cwr/.
Original optical flow code by Hidetoshi Shimodaira shimo@is.titech.ac.jp.

This code is designed to work in the Eclipse IDE, though it can be modifed to run in Processing.
See the ProcessingDemo folder for examples that run in Processing 2 and Processing 3 (.zip file has them all).

Add Processing 2.x libraries core.jar and video.jar to the Eclipse Build Path. 
In Processing 3 you will need to install the Processing video library.
Add external libraries IgnoCodeLib (https://processing.org/reference/libraries/) and ControlP5 (http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) to the Build Path.

To save files, set the filePath variable to point to a directory in your system. 

The ProcessingDemo folder includes fairly complete information on moving code between Processing and Eclipse and strategies to incorporate .java files into Processing.
