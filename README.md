# Flocking

Examples of boids that draw, some driven by video optical flow.
Based on Flocking, by Daniel Shiffman <http://www.shiffman.net>, in The Nature of Code, Spring 2009.
Demonstration of Craig Reynolds' "Flocking" behavior, See: http://www.red3d.com/cwr/.
Original optical flow code by Hidetoshi Shimodaira shimo@is.titech.ac.jp.

This code is designed to work in the Eclipse IDE, though it can be modifed to run in Processing (2.x currently).
Add Processing 2.x libraries core.jar, video.jar (and perhaps jna.jar, g-streamer-java.jar) to the Eclipse Build Path.
Add IgnoCodeLib (https://processing.org/reference/libraries/) and ControlP5 (http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) to the Build Path.
